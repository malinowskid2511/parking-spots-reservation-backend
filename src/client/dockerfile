# Step 1: Use the official Node.js image as the base for the build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the package files and install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Step 4: Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Step 5: Build the Nest.js application
RUN npm run build

# Step 6: Use a smaller base image for production
FROM node:18-alpine

# Step 7: Set the working directory in the production container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 8: Copy only the necessary files from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/package.json /app/package.json
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules

# Step 9: Set environment variables for production
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Step 10: Expose the port for the application
EXPOSE 3000

# Step 11: Start the Nest.js application
CMD ["node", "dist/main"]
